    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> All pizza dough starts with the same basic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil. Here’s the
        breakdown of what I use in my homemade pizza crust recipe. </p>

    <h3> ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Yeast </li>
        <li> Water </li>
        <li> Flour </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
        <li> Sugar </li>
        <li> Cornmeal </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Instruction </h3>
    <h2>Part 1: Making the Dough</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong> In your large bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the
            yeast over the top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. It should become foamy and bubbly. This means your yeast is
            active and ready! If it doesn't foam, your water might have been too hot or cold, or your yeast is old.
            Start again with new yeast and check the water temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mix the Dough:</strong> Add the flour, salt, and olive oil to the foamy yeast mixture. Stir with a
            spoon or spatula until a shaggy dough forms and mostly comes together.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Lightly flour a clean surface (your counter or a large cutting board).
            Turn the dough out onto the floured surface. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes. Push it away with the
            heel of your hand, fold it over, and repeat. Add tiny bits of flour if it's too sticky, but try not to add
            too much. You want a smooth, elastic dough that springs back when you poke it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>First Rise:</strong> Lightly grease your large bowl with a little olive oil. Place the dough ball in
            the bowl, turning it over once to coat all sides with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean damp
            kitchen towel. Place it in a warm spot (like a turned-off oven with the light on, or a sunny spot) and let
            it rise for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Part 2: Assembling and Baking the Pizza</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> About 20-30 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to its
            highest setting (usually 450-500°F or 230-260°C). If you have a pizza stone or steel, put it in the oven to
            preheat with the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Pan:</strong> Lightly grease your pizza pan or baking sheet with olive oil. If you have
            cornmeal, sprinkle a thin layer of it over the greased pan – this helps with crispiness and prevents
            sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shape the Dough:</strong> Gently punch down the risen dough to release the air. Transfer it to your
            prepared pan. Use your hands to gently press and stretch the dough into your desired pizza shape (round or
            rectangular). Try to make the edges slightly thicker for a crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Add Toppings:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin, even layer of your tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Generously sprinkle your cheese over the sauce.</li>
                <li><em>Optional:</em> Add any other simple toppings you have, but remember not to overload it, or the
                    crust might not cook properly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong> Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until
            the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. Cooking time will vary depending on
            your oven and desired crispness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool for a few minutes before
            slicing and serving. This helps the cheese set and prevents burns!
